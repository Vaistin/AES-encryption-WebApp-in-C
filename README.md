# AES-encryption-WebApp-in-C
 A web application for cyphering and deciphering text in the AES system, written in C. The current version only supports AES-128.
 The comments are currently all in serbian, that'll be updated in due time.
 NOTE: The code only works on Windows systems, and you'll need to link it to the w2_32.lib file, which you'll need to download.
